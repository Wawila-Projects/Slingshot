# Slingshot
Minified C++ to Mips32 compiler using Flex and Bison. 

This project was built for a Compilers class in college. It serves to show the basics of a compiler. It uses Flex as the lexer and Bison as the parser followed by a basic semantic evaluation and code generation.


<H2>Caveats</H2>
1. It is built to run on an specific virtual machine to run it. It includes the libraries to show the print results and some other functions. It will be added later.
2. It does not support classes or passing arrays as parameters.
